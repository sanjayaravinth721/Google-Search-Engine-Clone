# Google Search Engine Clone
A Google search engine clone developed using web technologies, Java, and a database for storing collected information.

# Overview
This project aims to replicate the core functionalities of the popular Google search engine. It includes a web crawler, front-end design, back-end implementation, and a database for storing collected data. By mimicking the search engine's behavior, the clone allows users to search for websites and retrieve relevant results.

# Features
- Web Crawler: Implements a web crawler using Java to fetch website information. Utilizes DFS recursion to traverse website links and collect data.

- Database Storage: Utilizes JDBC to store collected information in a database. The database stores website links and associated data, including image links.

- User Interface: Implements a responsive and user-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Provides a search bar for entering queries and displays search results in a clean and intuitive manner.

# Technologies Used
- Java Servlets: Backend development using Java Servlets to handle user requests, process search queries, and retrieve relevant results from the database.

- JSP: Implements dynamic web pages using JavaServer Pages for server-side rendering of search results and UI components.

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Front-end development using these web technologies to create an appealing and interactive user interface.

- JDBC: Utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a connection with the database and perform data storage and retrieval operations.

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Google search engine clone locally:

- Configure the database: Create a database using your preferred database management system and import the provided schema file.
- Configure the database connection: Update the database connection settings in the configuration file.
- Build and run the project: Use your preferred Java development environment to build and run the project. Ensure all dependencies are resolved.
- Access the application: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the search engine clone.
